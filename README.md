# 🔐 **Secure Login System with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Using Flask**  

🚀 **Secure Login System** is a robust authentication system built with Flask, designed to enhance security using **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**. It ensures safe and verified access by requiring both a **password** and a **One-Time Password (OTP) via email** before granting user access.  

🔒 **Protect accounts with an extra layer of security using MFA!**

## 🌟 **Key Features**  

✅ **Secure User Authentication** – Users must enter a valid email and password to log in.  
✅ **Email-Based Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** – Sends a unique OTP to the user’s email for additional verification.  
✅ **Encrypted Password Storage** – Uses strong encryption techniques to securely store passwords.  
✅ **Session Management** – Ensures authenticated users remain logged in securely while preventing unauthorized access.  
✅ **Account Protection** – Implements measures to prevent brute-force attacks and unauthorized login attempts.  
✅ **Customizable Security Settings** – Allows modifications to OTP expiration time, email configurations, and UI elements.

## 🛠 **How It Works**  

1️⃣ **User Registration** – Users create an account, and credentials are securely stored in the database.  
2️⃣ **Login with Password** – The system verifies the user's email and password.  
3️⃣ **OTP Verification** – Upon successful login, an OTP is sent to the registered email.  
4️⃣ **Access Granted** – If the OTP is correct, the user is authenticated and redirected to the dashboard.  
5️⃣ **Session Management** – Maintains secure login sessions until the user logs out.
